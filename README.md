# Educational Kids Game
- Frame 1 asks to choose between easy and hard mode
- Frame 2 and 3 are the easy and hard modes

# 
- should one batch of questions and answers be prepared , or mutiple ones ?

# for perplexity
now i wanna start working on frame2 that has the Easy Mode, i haven't decided exactly what the theme of the game will be, but i know its a quiz where i have a question and the user has to choose one of 4 options (buttons), then a new question with its options pop up, from each set of the 4 options there is only one correct one, this happens for a number of times (lets say for 5 questions) , at the end a results frame replaces the current frame that tells the user his score, so each answer he gives has to be counted if its correct or incorrect


now in the frame3 i want the exact same thing as frame2 but with a timer (lets say of 30sec), when the time is up (and the user hasn't clicked one of the buttons) the frame3 is replaced with a new frame that has a label saying the time is up , and a button to get back to frame3


now i want to tackle the timer stuff,
we are in frame 3 and the timer starts going down, when the time is up, i want a new frame,
